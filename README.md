# Bank Marketing Analysis - Streamlit
Streamlit web application that predicts the likelihood of bank customers subscribing to a term deposit from personal, monetary, and marketing features. Link to full app: https://sachinvs7-bank-marketing-streamlit-main-app-b00a9n.streamlitapp.com/

As I continue to test out more Streamlit elements, including the caching ones, below are a few screenshots. There are 3 tabs - one for EDA, one for the main classification above, and a third one for clustering wherein I group the customers using K-modes. Each tab has some interesting visualizations and selection components.
